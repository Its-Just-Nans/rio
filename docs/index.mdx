Welcome on the unofficial RIO Website

This website provides informations on the major "RIO" (Wireless networks and IoT) of Télécom Paris

---

The RIO track offers in-depth training in mobile networks and the Internet of Things (IoT).

While cellular networks have profoundly changed our communication usages, the Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to revolutionise health, industry, transportation, cities or entertainment.

Mobile networks and IoT, are therefore the two major components of the fifth generation to come.

With this track, students will become engineers, who are very familiar with existing technologies, but also able to design these networks of the future.

The track offers a balanced training between the generic principles of wireless networks, technological aspects (standards, protocols, architectures, including for mobile cloud computing), platform experiments, theoretical aspects (stochastic modeling for performance evaluation and optimization), and openings on current challenges.
